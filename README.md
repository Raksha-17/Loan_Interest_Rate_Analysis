Background:
I've joined a fintech startup tasked with improving customer loan offers. Using the ðŸ”—Bondora P2P Loans dataset, I'll build build insights about what factors help determine a person's interest rate. I will work your way to creating a predictive model to estimate loan interest rates, which will guide your company in personalizing loan terms efficiently.
